/**
 * This is a {@link Classifier} that examines a Throwable and returns a RetryPolicy to use based on
 * that Throwable. The purpose of this class is to introspect SubscriptionsExceptions that are
 * thrown by {@link AccountService}. SubscriptionsExceptions are thrown in two circumstances: if an
 * account is non-found or if there was some request or server error. For an account that is not
 * found, the server returns a 204 No Content, If the account isn't found, then we don't want to
 * retry. This Classifier looks at the HTTP response status in the exception and if the status is
 * 204, it returns a NeverRetryPolicy. Otherwise, it returns a default that is set during
 * construction.
